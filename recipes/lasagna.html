  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>f you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! The bacon,
    chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>1. Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat.
      Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't
      stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>2. Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the
      Parmesan cheese until melted.
    </li>
    <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives
      and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
